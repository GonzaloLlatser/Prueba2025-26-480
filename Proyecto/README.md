# 480 Technical Test - Java Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a technical test for 480, implemented in **Java**.
It demonstrates the creation of different rotatable objects and storage media (CD, Blu-ray, Hard Disk Drive, Vinyl LP, Frisbee, Wheel) using object-oriented programming concepts such as:

- Inheritance (abstract classes)

- Interfaces

- Enums

- Polymorphism

- Encapsulation

The project includes a Main class to instantiate objects, set attributes, and execute their behaviors, displaying output in a friendly and readable console format.
